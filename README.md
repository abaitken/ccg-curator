# Collectable Card Game Curator

A work in progress.

A .NET app to scan and quickly build a database of collected cards.

Currently only support Magic the Gathering but the intention is to adapt it to generically apply to other card games.

Based on the work here: https://github.com/alexander-pick/MKMEye
